File Storage - Public Access

	To make files in folder "storage" be accessed publicly, run this:

		php artisan storage:link

	In case the symbolic link doesn't work properly, try prepending 'storage/' before the path.

Using Foreign Keys in Database
	Laravel migrates tables by their timestamps in filename.
	In case there is an earlier table that has foreign on a later table, it will cause an error.
	One way to solve it is to alter the timestamp of the earlier table into a later timestamp.

	During testing when SQLite is being used, foreign key is automatically turned off.
	To turn on:
		DB::statement('PRAGMA foreign_keys=on');
	Put that in TestCase class to always enable it during testing.
